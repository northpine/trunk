It should also be noted that the distribution areas depicted on this map may not be complete or accurate in all cases due to incomplete data, the changing nature of fish distribution and use, or error in collecting or documenting the information. Original Data Sources Chinook Salmon Source for Snohomish R., Skykomish R. and Snoqualmie R.: Snohomish River Basin Work Group, Fish Mapping Workshop, August 16, 1995, Everett, Washington. Source for Sauk R., Suiattle R., Swamp Ck., North Ck. and Little Bear Ck.: Washington State Department of Fish & Wildlife; 1:100,000 scale StreamNet Data Base, Updated 1997. Source for Stillaguamish River Basin: WDFW Stream Catalog, Spawner Survey Database (WDFW) and the Technical Advisory Group of the Washington Conservation Commission, September 1999. Presumed Chinook Distribution In addition to the known and presumed distribution shown on this map, presumed habitat shall also include any areas that meet the following minimum physical parameters necessary to support chinook salmon during any life history stage. Spawning and holding habitat constitutes all accessible rivers and streams with a channel width of greater than or equal to 10 feet and gradient of less than or equal to 5%. Rearing habitat constitutes all accessible contiguous surface waters downstream of spawning habitat including streams, lakes, ponds, side-channels, sloughs, fresh water wetlands, estuarine tidal marsh and the lower half mile of accessible types 1,2 or 3 direct tributaries (less than or equal to 5% gradient) to streams which meet the spawning criteria. WRIA 8 Cedar-Sammamish Drainage - King County Department of Natural Resources, Water and Land Resources Division This map depicts the known freshwater distribution of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) for Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 8. The depicted limits of known freshwater distribution of chinook salmon are based upon the collective personal knowledge of participants in the WRIA 8 mapping project and data they gathered from published and unpublished databases. This map may underestimate or overestimate the actual distribution of chinook salmon Also, this map may inaccurately depict the location of water bodies. For example, some water bodies may be incorrectly located on this map, or may not be depicted on this map at all. All users of this map should seek the assistance of qualified professionals such as surveyors, hydrologists, or fishery biologists as needed to ensure that such users possess complete, precise, and up to date information on freshwater chinook salmon distribution and water body location. The information depicted on this map is current as of May 2000. This map may be revised at any time. Although the WRIA 8 Technical Committee intends to revise this map on an annual basis, the WRIA 8 Technical Committee cannot and does not guarantee that this map will be revised on an annual basis or at any other interval.

WRIA 9 Duwamish-Green Drainage - King County Department of Natural Resources, Water and Land Resources Division Credits: WRIA 9 Factors of Decline SubCommittee (King Cnty DNR, WLRD) History: This data was developed from two Fish Distribution Workshops held by the WRIA 9 Factors of Decline Subcommittee on May 18th, 1999 and May 24th, 2000. Participants in the workshops hailed from a range of affiliations both inside and outside King County ( list available here, scroll down). These workshops gathered existing fish distribution information for WRIA 9 and developed working draft maps and GIS data. This existing information came from published studies, as well as from personal observations and field data gathered from government and tribal agency officials, private consultants, non-profit representatives, and local and industry experts. The maps and GIS line data depict the best available information on the distribution of seven fish species: chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), chum (Oncorhynchus keta), pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). The maps and GIS point data also contain limited information regarding species age, spawning observations, outplant locations, fish barriers, and habitat condition"

Edits to the data area made using verified wetland reports that have been submitted to and accepted by the Thurston County Resource Stewardship Planning Department. This data was combined with updated wetland delineations, circa 2014, for the Deschutes Watershed Project area (TRPC) and updated with standards provided by the Thurston County Wetlands Working Group. The information from TRPC was created over several years by TRPC, Contractor's, GeoData. All edits and updates are approved by the Thurston County Resource Stewardship Current Planning or Long Range Planning Departments. This dataset was created to inform county staff and the public of where the critical wetland sites were located for planning purposes.  All data should be checked with the appropriate subject matter expert and any request for changes or updates sent to the Resource Stewardship Planning Department. Last Update made: 11/1/2017 by KAH."
